            Static storage, where each item stored is assigned a fixed place in the storage system, offers many advantages for a warehouse. Both static systems – also known as fixed space systems – and dynamic storage have strong advantages in certain logistics applications. Static warehousing, however, is primarily suitable for companies with consistent SKU profiles and quantities. It is also a good solution for a smaller company operating a manageable warehouse, since it does not necessarily require warehouse software.
            <br>
            <br>
            In static storage, each item stored is assigned a fixed location, where it must be stored. This means it is suited to applications where there are only minor fluctuations in average stock levels.
<br>
            Storage density decreases slightly compared to a dynamic system, but static storage offers the advantage of clear visibility of shortages or excess stocks. For this reason it is often used for lean production systems.
            <br>
            Setting out the maximum stock quantity will allow the use of flow racking for ‘First In, First Out’ (FIFO) storage, where goods stored first are also removed first. This principle is particularly suited to the handling of goods that have a defined shelf life whose quality will decrease as a result of lengthy storage, such as food or medicines.
